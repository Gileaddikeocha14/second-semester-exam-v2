Explanation of the Script:
The Script that helps install a master and slave in ubuntu vagrant machine and runs LAMP Stack.The script must have the following:
- Vagrant 
- Virtual box

Slave and Master:
      memory: 1024
      cpu's :2

The slave machine:
 Spec:
    name= slave1
    image=Ubuntu/focal64
  network:
        private_netwok
        constant ip:"192.168.20.11"

Slave configuration:
update and upgrade machine

Install:
 -sshpass:This allows you to chip in the password while looping in
 -switching the password authenticator on to logging using password
 -restart the sshd service 
 -installing avahi-deamon libnss-mdns

Master machine
    Spec:
      Host  name= master
       image=Ubuntu/focal64
    network:
        private_netwok
        constant ip:"192.168.20.10"

Master configuration:
    update and upgrade machine

Install:
    -sshpass:This allows you to chip in the password while looping in
    -switching the password authenticator on to logging using password
    -restart the sshd service 
    -installing avahi-deamon libnss-mdns

Script configuration:
  -creating a sudo user 
  -creating ssh key for the user "altschool"
  -copy the user "altschool" ssh to the slave machine(only the user should be able to ssh into      the slave machine with a password)
  -copy a file named"/mnt" from the "altschool" user to the slave machine

LAMP Stack (Master and Slave installation):
LAMP:(linux.apache2, mysql and php):
    -installing apache2
    -installing php and requirements
    -installing Mysql
    -Enanling modules
    -Restarting Apache

Fially a LAMP stack will be installed on both master and slave once the script runs.Apache is going to be restarted after installation and configuration.

And mysql server and client are going to be installed on both master and slave

Different versions of php is going to be installed and permissions for /var/www is going to be set to an owner and group of "www-data:www-data"
